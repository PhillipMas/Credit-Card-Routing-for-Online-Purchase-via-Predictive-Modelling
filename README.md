# Credit-Card-Routing-for-Online-Purchase-via-Predictive-Modelling
The plan in tackling this problem is to use Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining
(CRISP-DM) which is broken down into five chronological steps. First, understand the business
requirement , then understand the available data and prepare it for the model implementation,
then fit the model and predict , then evaluate the predicted results, and finally deploy the
working model.

The model implementation to solve the business problem will be a two-stage where the first
stage predicts the success rate and stage two inputs the preceding stage output to solve the
ultimate goal of selecting the best payment provider (PSP)based on the success rates and fees.
The report (CRISP-DM) process to solve for the Credit card routing for online purchases
problem. We begin with Exploratory Data Analysis (which in this case will commence at data
importing) where we get to know the data well through statistical analysis and visualization to
identify attributes distributions and relationships. We also identify data quality issues such as
missing values and data type and invoke the necessary fixes. Then, we move to pre-processing
the data, which includes the selection and formatting of the data for further modeling and
processing such encoding categorical variables, class balancing and scaling numeric features.
Thereafter, we proceed to model development where we select the modeling technique to be
used, then train and fit the various machine learning models, tune hyper-parameters for optimal
model performance and evaluate various machine learning models. This happens after the data
set has been randomly split into train and test data sets. Then, we evaluate the performance
of the various models in the results and discussion section. Relevant performance evaluation
metrics such as confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity are used to gauge
the performance of each model. We compare the performance of the different models and identify
the best-performing model based on the performance metrics.
In conclusion, we provide a summary of our project findings and discuss the importance of
the predictive model suggested in the project. We also recommend possible directions that
could be taken to improve the results.
